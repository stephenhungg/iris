"""Timeline endpoints — get (read current state) + put (save EDL snapshot).

GET returns both shapes: the flat segment span list (`segments`) built from
the DB, and when the user has saved manual edits, the full EDL snapshot
(`edl`) with split/trim/reorder/volume preserved. Clients that understand
the EDL should prefer it; the segment list remains for legacy callers and
a coarse fallback.

PUT accepts the full EDL and writes it to `Project.timeline_edl`. This is
the only mutation path for manual edits — AI accepts still flow through
/api/accept (which writes a Segment row) and the next auto-save picks up
the resulting clip.
