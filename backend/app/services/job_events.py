"""In-process pub/sub for per-job SSE log streams.

The generate worker publishes structured "thought process" events as it
moves through its stages (plan, veo generate, score, ...). The SSE route
in app.api.routes.jobs subscribes to these events and relays them to the
browser as text/event-stream.

Kept deliberately simple: a dict of job_id -> bounded history + a set of
asyncio.Queue subscribers. Survives only in the worker process, so if the
frontend re-opens the stream mid-run it replays whatever is still in
history, then blocks on new events.

Events are plain JSON-serialisable dicts. Convention used by the worker:
    { "ts": <unix seconds>, "stage": "plan_done", "msg": "...", "data": {...} }

Terminal events should set ``terminal=True`` so subscribers know to close.
